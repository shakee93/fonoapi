This is an API which can provide mobile device descriptions such as model, brand, CPU, GPU, dimensions, release date etc. It might be helpful if you are building a website like GSMAera, Phonearena or something similar. This API contains a database of a mobile device descriptions of Android, iOS and some old phones too.. :D
This is the PHP class to communicate with the API. It would be nice if someone can help with other languages though. ;)

### Api
